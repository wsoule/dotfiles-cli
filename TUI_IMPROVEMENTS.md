# TUI Improvements Summary

## ✅ What Was Improved

The TUI has been enhanced to be **cross-platform aware**, inspired by lazygit's design philosophy.

### 1. **Cross-Platform Awareness**

The TUI now automatically detects and displays:
- **Operating System** (`darwin`, `linux`)
- **Package Manager** (`homebrew`, `pacman`, `apt`, `yum`)

This information is shown in:
- Tab bar (top right corner)
- Stats view (detailed system information)

### 2. **Enhanced Stats View**

The stats view now shows:

```
📊 Package Statistics
   Total Packages:      X
   Installed:           X
   In Config:           X
   Configuration Drift: X

💻 System Information
   Operating System:    darwin/linux
   Package Manager:     homebrew/pacman/apt/yum

📂 Additional Data
   Disk Space:          ...
   Last Sync:           ...
   Snapshots:           X
   Profiles:            X
```

**Platform-Specific Notes:**
- macOS: Explains Homebrew brews vs casks
- Arch Linux: Explains both are treated as packages
- Other Linux: Shows the detected package manager
